## Getting Started

###### Clone

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mikejoyceio/foundation-react-boilerplate
```

###### Install Yarn

Yarn can be installed through the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/). This will also install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which is required) if it is not already installed.

Details installation instructions for all operating systems can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

To make sure you have Yarn installed, run the following command to check the version:

```
$ yarn -v
```

###### Install Dependencies

```
$ yarn install 
```

###### Run Webpack

## The Build

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a JavaScript module bundler that generates static assets, which takes care of a number of common frontend tasks in this boilerplate.

```

###### Production 

```
